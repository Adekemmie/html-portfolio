<h4>My favorite movie. I love the dark wit, fantastic characters, and unmistakable Burtonesque aesthetic.</h4></p>

<p><h3>Scream</h3>
<h4>Awesome movie. Note: Don't watch if you hate horror.</h4></p>

<p><h3>The Pale Blue Eye</h3>
<h4>I love this one, it's a fictional story. The story has soft spots, but it mostly makes up for them with creepy atmosphere and some really impressive performances.</h4></p>
